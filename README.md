## 📖 About the Project

What started as a simple **JavaScript course project** on [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com)  
quickly turned into something much more ambitious.

- Began as a **basic Blackjack** in plain JS.
- Rebuilt from scratch in **Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite** for better structure, maintainability, and UI flexibility.
- Added **new game logic, betting system, and polished user interface** with a modern glass/gold theme.
- Fully **responsive** and optimized for mobile devices — playable as a standalone PWA.

> *"Where there's a will, there's a way."* – This project is the first step on my bigger journey as a Vue developer.
